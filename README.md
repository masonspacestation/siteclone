Scout Cyclecraft is a brand I created to express my love for adventure cycling. I created this single page website to flesh the brand out a bit more.

### Improved Skills
This site was my introduction to Bootstrap. I learned about breakpoints for a responsive layout. I also learned about using relative positioning to create overlapping elements. Iâ€™d like to add a searchable database of bikes and experiment with setting up a shop next.

### Dynamic Layout
I used Bootstrap to create the responsive layout, with breakpoints as well as toggling visibility and changing the order of certain elements. I also created a bottom navbar for mobile view instead of keeping the collapsible dropdown at top.

### Branding and Design
I designed the brand, including logo, color and typography selection, copywriting, and marketing material.

### Requirements
- Proper use of the Bootstrap Grid System to maintain page architecture (no improperly nested classes)

- On mobile any elements sharing a row should stack

- Uses @media rule to hide text over image on mobile

- The card spills out of row only on medium and larger screen sizes

- Imports custom font, and uses on at least one element

- Sticky Navbar on scroll

- Must use external Icon library

- Specified elements order changes based on screen size

- Cards are vertically centered with the center card larger for emphasis
